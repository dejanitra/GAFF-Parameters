# General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) Parameters
This repository contains General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) charge parameters for organic compounds along with their structures.


The general steps of parameterization conducted are as follows:

(1) structure optimization at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory,

(2) calculation of ESP charges at the HF/6-31G(d) level of theory, and

(3) fitting RESP charges using Antechamber.
