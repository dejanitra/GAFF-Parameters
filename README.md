# General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) Parameters
This repository contains GAFF charge and structural parameters (*.lib and *.frcmod) for organic compounds, along with their structures in PDB format.


The general steps of parameterization conducted are as follows:

(1) structure optimization at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory,

(2) calculation of ESP charges at the HF/6-31G(d) level of theory, and

(3) fitting RESP charges using Antechamber.
